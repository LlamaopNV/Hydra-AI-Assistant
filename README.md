Hydra-AI-Assistant.
================================

The following project has been my main project for the majority of 2023. The current uploaded build is not the complete project, the updated versions will have the functionality.

Goal of application.
================================
Objective: This application aims to leverage various role-specified AI agents through the OpenAI API.

Innovation Using Assistant API:
The integration of the Assistant API function has significantly streamlined and made redundant a substantial portion of the previous manual work.

Agent Creation and Task Fulfillment:
The application operates by creating a set of "agents" tailored to specific tasks. For instance, in the provided flow diagram, Hydra was utilized to develop a series of agents facilitating the Software Development Life Cycle. The flexibility of the application allows the creation of agents for a wide array of tasks.

Event Orchestration:
The primary application serves as the event orchestrator, ensuring that independent agents function within their designated roles.

Challenges and Progress:
Presently, the development progress of this application is influenced by the substantial costs associated with executing numerous asynchronous API calls. Despite this challenge, significant individual progress has been made.

Future Updates:
Regular updates will be provided to showcase the evolving capabilities of the application. The aim is to publicly demonstrate its potential across various domains.
