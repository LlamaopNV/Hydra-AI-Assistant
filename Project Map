Introduction:

The purpose of this document is to outline the development of an application that can create other applications through a text request prompt. The system will rely on independent API calls to OpenAI, each of which will serve a specific function in building an application. To achieve this, we will be using the Hydra method, which involves breaking down a larger task into multiple smaller sub-tasks that can be handled independently by separate APIs.

To develop this application, we will need to consider several key components, including the user interface, database, API calls, reference code, testing, and storage for current projects. We will need to carefully plan and integrate each of these components to ensure that the application functions correctly and meets our requirements.

The following sections will provide a detailed explanation of each component and the considerations that need to be made for its implementation.
